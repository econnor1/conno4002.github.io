Hello! My name is Eric Connor and currently a 2nd year M.S. student in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota. My passion is using data-driven decision-making to improve public health. I consistently overlayed my classical biostatistics and mathematical training with applied collaborations in academia and government. In doing so, I developed strong teamwork skills, expanded my understanding of a wide variety of statistical techniques, and prepared myself to contribute to a team shaping the future of public health. Some of my various research interests include clinical trials, Bayesian statistics, survival analysis, and causal inference. My passion is using data-driven decision-making to improve public health.

Outside of my professional interests, I am also an avid sports fan. I support the Baltimore Orioles, Washington Capitals, and my undergraduate UMBC Retrievers! Currently, I have one of the worst March Madness brackets in the country.
